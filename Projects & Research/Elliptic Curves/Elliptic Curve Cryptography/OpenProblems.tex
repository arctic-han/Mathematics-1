\chapter{Open Problems and Future Directions}

\hspace{10mm} This work provided some basic definitions and showed some properties of elliptic curves as a whole. In a future project, types of elliptic curves could be studied as well as explore elliptic curves with characteristic 2 or 3. Additionally, elliptic curves could be studied over the complex and the rationals.

\hspace{10mm} More examples of elliptic curves could be presented as well as all of the calculations done for the one in this work but for each of them. This would show how the formulas work for different forms of elliptic curves. Also, in a future work, an isomorphism could be found with the example elliptic curve provided in this work as well as for others that could be added. 

\hspace{10mm} The elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) is where the elliptic curve crypstosystem draws its strength. This could be further explained in a future work. Other types of cryptosystems that use elliptic curves such as the analog of Massey Omura could be described in a future project, these may include analog of Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECDH) and analog of ElGamal.
