Consider the equation $x^2-117x+31=0$. We claim that there are no integer solutions to this equation. Let $n$ be an integer
, then $n$ is either even or odd. If $n$ is even, then so is  $n^2$ and  $17n$; hence $x^2-117x+31$ is odd. Likewise if $n$ 
is odd, then so is $n^2$ and  $117n$, thus $x^2-117x+31$ is even and so we see that $x^2-117x+31$ is never $0$.
