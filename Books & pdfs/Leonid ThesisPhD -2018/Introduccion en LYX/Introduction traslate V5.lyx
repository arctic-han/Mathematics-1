Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental and discrete mathematics play a very important role in
 the development of this thesis.
 It's precisely in these two branches of research that the family of symmetric
 functions defined over Galois fields has reached a special interest.
 Moreover, it could be said that in the last decades the family of symmetrical
 Boolean functions has acquired a greater importance in the area of applicable
 mathematics.
 Thus, over time, the study of these functions have helped to obtain great
 advances in applications, for example, today they are active areas of research
 as the experimental mathematical, combinatorial theory, coding theory,
 cryptography, the theory of error-correcting codes, game theory and electrical
 engineering (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "BCP,cai,cm1,cm3,cusickstanica,dalaimaitrasarkar,hell,stanicamaitra,stanicamaitraclark"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below we present some of the main components of this thesis in a brief conceptua
l framework taking as an example, the Boolean space.
 That is, all the mathematical objects mentioned in this first part of the
 introduction are defined in a similar way for other Galois fields (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{q}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 a power of a prime 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

).
 similar all the results of the research.
 To begin with, one of the firsts mathematical objects used and highlighted
 in this section is that of a Boolean function.
 A Boolean function is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F^{*}:\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{F}_{2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For the purpose of this investigation, we frequently use the polynomial
 representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $F^{*}$
\end_inset

 known as algebraic normal form (ANF) of 
\begin_inset Formula $F^{*}$
\end_inset

 and we identify it as a function 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 variables over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{2}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "canteaut,licusick1"

\end_inset

.
 In addition it should be noted that, within the family of Boolean functions,
 there are functions that fulfill an important property, that of being symmetric.
 It is said that a Boolean function 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is symmetric if it is verified that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
F\left(x_{1},\cdots,x_{n}\right)=F\left(x_{\sigma\left(1\right)},\cdots,x_{\sigma\left(n\right)}\right),
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is any permutation of the symmetric group 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, for simplicity it is said that 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is symmetric if the subindices of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{1},\cdots,x_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 can be permuted so that the resulting function is invariant.
 Within the family of the symmetric Boolean functions, two important functions
 that will be studied in this investigation are highlighted: the elementary
 symmetric Boolean polynomial and the rotation symmetric Boolean function.
 The symmetric Boolean function can be associated with an exponential sum
 and define as a second main mathematical object.
 The exponential sum of symmetric Boolean function is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S\left(F\right)=\sum_{X\in\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}}\left(-1\right)^{F\left(X\right)}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

To continue complementing the mathematical objects used in this thesis,
 especially in Chapter 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, knowledge of the properties of homogeneous linear recurrence sequences
 with integer coefficients is required (see next section).
 The sequences of exponential sums, such as the sequences of exponential
 sums of elementary symmetric functions and rotation symmetric functions
 are well studied throughout this workt.
 In particular, for research on the sequences of exponential sums of symmetric
 Boolean functions, it is very important to highlight the following relation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
wt(F)=\frac{2^{n}-S(F)}{2},\label{eq:4}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{wt}(F)$
\end_inset

 is the weight of Hamming (
\begin_inset Formula $\text{wt}(F)$
\end_inset

 counts the number of non-zero components of the 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{F}=\left(F\left(X_{1}\right),\ldots,F\left(X_{2^{n}}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cusick4,cusickArXiv,cusickjohns,cusickstanica"

\end_inset

.
 More precisely, the equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:4"

\end_inset

) postulates that, any sequence of exponential sums of symmetric Boolean
 functions satisfying a homogeneous linear recurrence with integer coefficients,
 would lead to the respective Hamming weights sequence of these functions,
 also would satisfy one of these homogeneous linear recurrence (see Chapter
 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

).
 In other investigations where equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:4"

\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cm1,cusickArXiv"

\end_inset

 is studied, known that this relationship involves two important properties
 over Boolean functions, such properties are the weight of Hamming and the
 exponential sum.
 In the area of cryptography, in particular, the criterion of the balanced
 of a Boolean function is investigated; in this case, equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:4"

\end_inset

) us allows to relate the balancing of an elementary symmetric Boolean polynomia
l 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $W_{\mathcal{F}}$
\end_inset

 has the same number of zero and one's components) through its exponential
 sum 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cm3,cusick2"

\end_inset

.
 For example, a Boolean function 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is balanced if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $S\left(F\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important aspect in this research and presented in Chapter 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

, is the efficiency in the computation of the implementations of the closed
 formulas established in the results of this chapter, that is, in this thesis
 we present closed formulas of efficient calculations.
 For example, the closed formula of exponential sums that generalize the
 result of Cai, Green, and Thierauf 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cai"

\end_inset

.
 From the definition itself, several of the properties on the mathematical
 objects mentioned previously would be quite expensive to verify them, for
 example, the verification of the balanced of a Boolean function using the
 Hamming weight of a symmetric Boolean function is not very efficient.
 Moreover, the closed formulas of Chapter 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 corroborate or support the verification of the Stanica-Li-Cusick conjecture
 asymptotically for Galois fields 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cm1"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Already on Galois fields, we present an important relationship that opens
 a new approach for future research.
 In Chapter 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 we present closed formulas that link the exponential sums of symmetric
 polynomials over any Galois field with one related to the problem of the
 bisecting binomial coefficients.
 A solution 
\begin_inset Formula $(\delta_{0},\delta_{1},\cdots,\delta_{n})$
\end_inset

 to the equation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j=0}^{n}\delta_{j}\binom{n}{j}=0,\,\,\,\delta_{j}\in\{-1,1\},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

is said to give a

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{n}{j}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq j\leq n.$
\end_inset

 To end this part of the chapter, we define next the exponential sum of
 a symmetric polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 defined over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{q}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S_{\mathbb{F}_{q}}\left(P\right)=\sum_{x\in\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}}\zeta_{p}^{Tr_{\mathbb{F}_{q}/\mathbb{F}_{p}}\left(P\left(x\right)\right)}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{p}=e^{\frac{2\pi i}{p}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Tr_{\mathbb{F}_{q}/\mathbb{F}_{p}}$
\end_inset

 is the trace function defined from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{q}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 The symmetric polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and its trace (defined over Galois fields), is in active research, for
 example, in the case of balanced of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 are directly related to the study of the trace function 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In the following sections, we introduce a summary on the theme of linear
 recurrences of symmetric functions, associated recursions of special functions
 and closed formulas of symmetric polynomial over Galois fields (Chapters
 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 respectively).

\begin_inset Formula $a_{0},a_{1},\cdots,a_{k-1}$
\end_inset

\end_inset

If initial values 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0},s_{1},\cdots,s_{k-1}$

 of the sequence are provided, the recurrence relation defines the rest
 of the seuqence uniquely.
 Such a sequence es said to order 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 Also we say that the recurrrence (

) is homogeneous, if 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0$
\end_inset

 For example, the exponential sums of the Boolean function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
{\scriptstyle {\scriptstyle F_{n}({\bf X})=X_{1}X_{2}X_{4}+X_{2}X_{3}X_{5}+\cdots+X_{n-3}X_{n-2}X_{n}+X_{n-2}X_{n-1}X_{1}+X_{n-1}X_{n}X_{2}+X_{n}X_{1}X_{3}}}

\end_inset

, the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ S\left(F_{n}({\bf X})\right)\right\} _{n\geq4}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{n}=2a_{n-1}+2a_{n-2}-4a_{n-3}+4a_{n-5}-8a_{n-6}

\end_inset

where the first integers of recurrence are 
\begin_inset Formula

 Other example, the next symmetric function of order

\begin_inset Formula $\left(\ref{MoregeneralTHMSymmetric}\right)$

The homogeneous sequence that satisfies
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\ref{eq:7}\right)$

 can be associated with the following polynomial,

 or to the linear recurrence sequence
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ s_{n}\right\} _{n\in\mathbb{N}}$
\end_inset

.
 In practice, when all the roots 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{k}\left(X\right)$
\end_inset

 are different, then the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{k}a_{i}\lambda_{i}^{n}$
\end_inset

 satisfies linear recurrence sequence of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\ref{eq:7}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, if we denote 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{k}a_{i}\lambda_{i}^{n}$
\end_inset

, we can say that the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0},s_{1},\cdots$
\end_inset

 satisfies a homogeneous linear recurrence of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\ref{eq:7}\right)$
\end_inset

 such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{k}\left(X\right)=\prod_{i=1}^{k}\left(X-\lambda_{i}\right)

\end_inset

 is its characterist polynomial.

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
P_{2^{r}-1}\left(X\right)=\prod_{i=0}^{2^{r}-1}\left(X-\lambda_{i}\right)
\end{equation}

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{j}=1+\zeta_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}=2^{n}$
\end_inset

 are the roots of the polynomial (all different).
 In other words, we can for a fixed integer 
\begin_inset Formula $l$

\begin_inset Formula $n\geq2^{l}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula

by the theorem (

\begin_layout Section
Recursion associated to some special functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the theorem 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\ref{MoregeneralTHMSymmetric}\right)$
\end_inset

 of the Chapter 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

, establishes that for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq k$
\end_inset

, the elementary symmetric polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{n,k}$
\end_inset

 associated with the exponential sum 
\begin_inset Formula $S\left(\boldsymbol{e}_{n,k}\right)$
\end_inset

 generates a homogeneous recurrent sequence of linear origin and with integer
 coefficients.
 Similarly by the theorem L of chapter 2 it is established in the same way
 that other two important functions satisfy homogeneous linear recurrence,
 we enumerate them, the first is the function initially defined by Pieprzyk
 an Qu in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "piequ"

\end_inset

 called the rotation symmetric Boolean function.
 Some examples of rotation symmetric functions are given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{2,3,4}({\bf 5})=X_{1}X_{2}X_{3}+X_{2}X_{3}X_{4}+X_{3}X_{4}X_{1}+X_{4}X_{1}X_{2}\label{eq:5}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

  and
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{2}(n)=X_{1}X_{2}+X_{2}X_{3}+\cdots+X_{n-1}X_{n}+X_{n}X_{1},\label{eq:6}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the indices are taken modulo n or are variant under circular translation
 of indices (see formal definition chapter 2), and the second function is
 the trapezoidal function.
 An example of a trapezoidal function is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\tau_{7,3}=X_{1}X_{2}X_{3}+X_{2}X_{3}X_{4}+X_{3}X_{4}X_{5}+X_{4}X_{5}X_{6}+X_{5}X_{6}X_{7}
\]

\end_inset

The name trapezoid comes from counting the number of times each variable
 appears in the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{n,k}$
\end_inset

.
 For example, consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{7,3}$
\end_inset

.
 Observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}$
\end_inset

 appears 1 time in 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{7,3}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{2}$
\end_inset

 appears 2 times, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{3}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{4}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{5}$

\begin_layout Section
Closed formulas for some special exponential sum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The closed formulas of exponential sums associated with the elementary symmetric
 polynomial defined over field of galois are the central axis in the research
 presented in chapter 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

.
 It is well known in many areas of the mathematics that the tool of discrete
 fourier transform is a mathematical object used for fast and efficient
 calculations.
 In this thesis, chapter 3, presents how to obtain a characteristic polynomial
 of a linear recurrence homogeneous of exponential sums of symmetric polynomials
 defined over Galois field.
 In the same way as shown, in the equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:9"

\end_inset

), Boolean case.
 For example, the theorem 
\begin_inset Formula $3.1$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cm1"

\end_inset

 is a general Boolean version of result of Cai, Green, and Thierauf.
 Similar to equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\ref{eq:9}\right)$
\end_inset

, let 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq k_{1}<\cdots<k_{s}$
\end_inset

 be fixed integers and 
\begin_inset Formula $r=\lfloor\log_{2}(k_{s})\rfloor+1$
\end_inset

.
 The value of the exponential sum 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S(\boldsymbol{e}_{n,[k_{1},\cdots,k_{s}]})=S(\boldsymbol{e}_{n,k_{1}})+\cdots+S(\boldsymbol{e}_{n,k_{s}})
\]

\end_inset

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S(\boldsymbol{e}_{n,[k_{1},\cdots,k_{s}]})=c_{0}2^{n}+\sum_{j=1}^{2^{r}-1}c_{j}\lambda_{j}^{n},\label{eq:1.3.1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{j}=1+\zeta_{j}$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{j}=e^{\frac{\pi i\,j}{2^{r-1}}},\,\,i=\sqrt{-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

 are constant elements.
 The formula 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:1.3.1"

\end_inset

 is a closed formula for exponential sum 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\boldsymbol{e}_{n,[k_{1},\cdots,k_{s}]})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The formula in equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:1.3.1"

\end_inset

) implicitly depends on the discrete fourier transform to reach it (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cai,cm1"

\end_inset

).
 The implementation of these formulas in any mathematics program allows
 the calculation of the value of the exponential sum 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\boldsymbol{e}_{n,[k_{1},\cdots,k_{s}]})$
\end_inset

 to be efficient in any computer.
 Once again, the discrete fourier transform and mathematical object of circulat
 matrices are the basis for obtaining the closed formulas of 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\boldsymbol{e}_{n,k})$
\end_inset

 for any Gaois field (see chapter 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

).
 The closed formula of 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\boldsymbol{e}_{n,k})$
\end_inset

 allows us to show that the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ S(\boldsymbol{e}_{n,k})\right\} $
\end_inset

 satisfies homogeneous linear recurrences with integer coefficients (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ccms"

\end_inset

).
 Also in chapter 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

, the Theorem 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\ref{expsumformthm}\right)$
\end_inset

 whose implementation in an old computer (whose features are not top of
 the art) of the research, it took 
\shape italic

\begin_inset Formula $Mathematica$
\end_inset


\shape default
 
\begin_inset Formula $0.008$
\end_inset

seconds to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S_{\mathbb{F}_{3}}(\boldsymbol{e}_{12,5})=346113+92664e^{\frac{2i\pi}{3}}+92664e^{-\frac{2i\pi}{3}}=253449.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In comparison, it took 26.6 minutes when using the definition of the exponential
 sum.
 The same implementation can be used to obtain values of exponential sums
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 relatively big.
 For instance, it took 
\shape italic
Mathematica
\shape default
 
\begin_inset Formula $1.28$
\end_inset

 seconds to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\textsc{S_{\mathbb{F}_{3}}(\boldsymbol{e}_{100,7})=113935090835950800739864834563949291416514642941,}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $41.28$
\end_inset

 seconds to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S_{\mathbb{F}_{4}}(\boldsymbol{e}_{50,5})=158735097466874432874732322816.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It took about two minutes and a half to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\mathbb{F}_{3}}(\boldsymbol{e}_{500,11})$
\end_inset

, which is an integer with 
\begin_inset Formula $239$
\end_inset

 digits.
 For the Boolean case, the study of the equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:1.3.1"

\end_inset

) leads us to the demonstration of the cusick conjecture, Li and Stanica
 asymptotically (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cm1"

\end_inset

).
 It is clear that the computation of the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\mathbb{F}_{q}}\left(F\right)$
\end_inset

 is an exponentially hard problem, moreover, still the study of the closed
 formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\mathbb{F}_{q}}\left(\boldsymbol{e}_{n,k}\right)$
\end_inset

 remains as an open research problem: the verification of the Cusick, Li,
 Stanica conjecture asymptotically for fields Galois (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "acgmr"

\end_inset

).
 On the other hand, the closed formula (see theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "expsumformthm"

\end_inset

) shows a link between exponential sums of symmetric polynomials over Galois
 fields and a problem for multinomial coefficients which is similar to the
 problem of bisecting binomial coefficients.
 The elementary symmetric Boolean polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{e}_{n,k}$
\end_inset

 can be represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{i}{k}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $wt(X)=j$
\end_inset

 is the Hamming weight of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S(\boldsymbol{e}_{n,k})=\sum_{j=0}^{n}(-1)^{\binom{j}{k}}\binom{n}{j}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This last equation is related to two Boolean mathematical problems of interest
 in cryptography: the balanced of a Boolean function and the problem of
 bisection of the binomial coefficients (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "cusick2,cusick2.1,mitchell"

\end_inset

).
 A solution 
\begin_inset Formula $(\delta_{0},\delta_{1},\cdots,\delta_{n})$
\end_inset

 to the equation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j=0}^{n}\delta_{j}\binom{n}{j}=0,\,\,\,\delta_{j}\in\{-1,1\},\label{bisec}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

is said to give a bisection of the binomial coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{n}{j}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq j\leq n.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To finish this introduction the formula closed for 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\mathbb{F}_{q}}(\boldsymbol{e}_{n,k})$
\end_inset

 is not only to computational improvement over the formal definition of
 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\mathbb{F}_{q}}(F)$
\end_inset

, but also provide a link to a similar problem to the problem of bisecting
 binomial coefficients (for multinomial coefficients).
 For example.
 suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{3}=\mathbb{Z}_{3}$
\end_inset

 is the Galois field of 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 elements.
 Then a explicit formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\mathbb{F}_{3}}(\boldsymbol{e}_{4,2})$
\end_inset

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{\mathbb{F}_{3}}(\boldsymbol{e}_{4,2})=\sum_{m_{1}=0}^{4}\sum_{m_{2}=0}^{4-m_{1}}{4 \choose m_{0}^{*},m_{1},m_{2}}e^{\left(\frac{2\pi i}{3}\right)\left(\Lambda_{1,-1}(2,m_{1},m_{2})\right)}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda_{1,-1}(2,m_{1},m_{2})=\sum_{j=0}^{m_{2}}{\text{m_{2}} \choose j}{\text{m_{1}} \choose 2-j}\left(-1\right)^{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{0}^{*}=4-(m_{1}+m_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, the fact that exponential sums of symmetric polynomials over
 finite fields can be expressed as multinomial sums is later used in the
 proof of closed formulas for them.
 The proof of the closed formulas also depends on a classical result in
 number theory known as Lucas' Theorem.

A Boolean function is a function from the vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Boolean functions are part of a beautiful branch of combinatorics with
 applications to many scientific areas.
 Some particular examples are the areas of theory of error-correcting codes
 and cryptography.
 Efficient cryptographic implementations of Boolean functions with many
 variables is a challenging problem due to memory restrictions of current
 technology.
 Because of this, symmetric Boolean functions are good candidates for efficient
 implementations.
 However, symmetry is too special a property and may imply that these implementa
tions are vulnerable to attacks.

 A

\begin_inset Formula $C_{n}$
\end_inset

 on the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us explain this definition in a more concrete way.
 Our explanation is similar to the one presented in

 A rotation symmetric Boolean function of the form

\begin_inset Formula $\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$

 For example, the rotation symmetric Boolean function (

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R({\bf X})=R_{2,3}(5)+R_{3}(5).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Sometimes the notation

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned in the introduction, in this work we present a method that
 could be used to generalize Cusick's result over any Galois field.
 In particular, we show that exponential sums over finite fields of some
 rotation symmetric polynomials are linear recurrent with integer coefficients.
 The 
\shape italic

Linear recurrences over

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we show that Cuscik's result is not unique to the Boolean
 case.
 In fact, exponential sums over finite fields of rotation polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{j_{1},\cdots,j_{s}}(n)$
\end_inset

 (and linear combination of them) satisfy linear recurrences with constant
 coefficients.
 This is a generalization of Cusick's result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the Galois field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{q}=\{0,\alpha_{1},\cdots,\alpha_{q-1}\}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $q=p^{r}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 prime and 
\begin_inset Formula $r\geq1$
\end_inset

.
 The recall that the exponential sum of a function 
\begin_inset Formula $F:\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}\to\mathbb{F}_{q}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S_{\mathbb{F}_{q}}(F)=\sum_{{\bf x}\in\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}}e^{\frac{2\pi i}{p}\text{Tr}_{\mathbb{F}_{q}/\mathbb{F}_{p}}(F({\bf x}))},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Tr}_{\mathbb{F}_{q}/\mathbb{F}_{p}}$
\end_inset

 represents the field trace function from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{q}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 The same technique used for exponential sums of Boolean functions can be
 used in general.
 However, instead of having two options for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

switch", we now have 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 of them.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 be a variable which takes values on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{q}$
\end_inset

.
 As before, we say that the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 can be turned 
\shape italic
OFF
\shape default
 or 
\shape italic
ON
\shape default
, however, this time the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

turn 
\shape italic
OFF
\shape default
" means that 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 assumes the value 0, while the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

turn 
\shape italic
ON
\shape default
" means that 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 assumes all values in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{q}$
\end_inset

 that are different from zero.
 Think of this situation as a light switch on which you have the option
 to turn 
\shape italic
OFF
\shape default
 the light and the option to turn it 
\shape italic
ON
\shape default
 to one of 
\begin_inset Formula $q-1$

This article is divided as follows.
 The next section contains some preliminaries.
 In Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "multinomialsums"

\end_inset

 we provide multinomial sum expressions for exponential sums of symmetric
 polynomials over Galois fields.
 We also include some representations that depend on integer partitions.
 These multinomial sums representations are a computational improvement
 over the formal definition of exponential sums.
 Moreover, as just mentioned, they provide a connection to a problem similar
 to the problem of bisecting binomial coefficients.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "closedformulas"

\end_inset

 is the core and final section of this article.
 It is also the section where the main results are presented.
 In particular, we find closed formulas for some multinomial sums.
 This, together with multinomial sum representations for our exponential
 sums, allow us to prove closed formulas for exponential sums of linear
 combinations of elementary symmetric polynomials over finite fields.
 We also provide explicit linear recurrences for such exponential sums,
 showing that the recursive nature of these sequences is not special to
 the binary case.
 Moreover, every multi-variable function over a finite field extension of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{2}$
\end_inset

 can be identified with a Boolean function.
 Thus, these results also provide new families of Boolean functions that
 might be useful for efficient implementations.

Closed formulas for exponential sums of symmetric polynomial
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Preliminaries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a well-established result in the theory of Boolean functions that
 any symmetric Boolean function can be identified with a linear combination
 of elementary symmetric Boolean polynomials.
 To be more precise, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{e}_{n,k}$
\end_inset

 be the elementary symmetric polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 variables of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boldsymbol{e}_{4,3}=X_{1}X_{2}X_{3}\oplus X_{1}X_{4}X_{3}\oplus X_{2}X_{4}X_{3}\oplus X_{1}X_{2}X_{4},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\oplus$
\end_inset

 represents addition modulo 2.
 Every symmetric Boolean function 
\begin_inset Formula $F({\bf X})$
\end_inset

 can be identified with an expression of the form where 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq k_{1}<k_{2}<\cdots<k_{s}$
\end_inset

 are integers.
 For the sake of simplicity, the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{e}_{n,[k_{1},\ldots,k_{s}]}$
\end_inset

 is used to denote (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "genboolsym"

\end_inset

).
 For example, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq k_{1}<\cdots<k_{s}$
\end_inset

 be fixed integers and 
\begin_inset Formula $r=\lfloor\log_{2}(k_{s})\rfloor+1$
\end_inset

.
 The value of the exponential sum 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\boldsymbol{e}_{n,[k_{1},\cdots,k_{s}]})$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
S(\boldsymbol{e}_{n,[k_{1},\cdots,k_{s}]}) & = & c_{0}(k_{1},\cdots,k_{s})2^{n}+\sum_{j=1}^{2^{r}-1}c_{j}(k_{1},\cdots,k_{s})(1+\zeta_{j})^{n},
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{j}=e^{\frac{\pi i\,j}{2^{r-1}}},i=\sqrt{-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
c_{j}(k_{1},\cdots,k_{s})=\frac{1}{2^{r}}\sum_{t=0}^{2^{r}-1}(-1)^{\binom{t}{k_{1}}+\cdots+\binom{t}{k_{s}}}\zeta_{j}^{-t}.\label{coeffs}

In this section we prove a formula for

 in terms of multinomial coefficients.
 This formula is a computational improvement over (

 We start by finding a formula, in this case, a recursive one, for the value

 Let

 recursively by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Lambda_{a_{1},a_{2},\cdots,a_{l+1}}(k,m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{l+1})=\sum_{j=0}^{m_{l+1}}\binom{m_{l+1}}{j}a_{l+1}^{j}\Lambda_{a_{1},\cdots,a_{l}}(k-j,m_{1},m_{2},\cdots,m_{l}),

 For example, using an implementation of Theorem

 This common sum must be

 Observe that every time

 This connection generalizes the one that exists between bisections of binomial

\begin_layout Example

\begin_layout Standard
As in the Boolean case, we may try to define trivial 
\begin_inset Formula $(p,q)$
\end_inset

-sections.
 A possible way to do this is to say that a 
\begin_inset Formula $(p,q)$
\end_inset

-section is trivial if 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{1}(n;k)=l_{2}(n;k)=\cdots=l_{p}(n;k)$
\end_inset

 Again, following the binary case, we say that a symmetric polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}\boldsymbol{e}_{n,k_{1}}+\cdots+\beta_{s}\boldsymbol{e}_{n,k_{s}}$
\end_inset

 is trivially balanced over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{q}$
\end_inset

 if its related 
\begin_inset Formula $(p,q)$
\end_inset

-section is trivial.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{e}_{5,3}$
\end_inset

 is trivially balanced, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{e}_{6,5}+\boldsymbol{e}_{6,3}$
\end_inset

 is not.
 It would be interesting to know if some results known for the binary case
 also apply to this problem.

 In particular, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{q,k}(X)$

 are repeated multiple times.
 For instance, consider Example

 Observe that when 
\begin_inset Formula $(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3})=(2,1,0)$

 we get the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $X-(1+i)$

 However when 
\begin_inset Formula $(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3})=(3,1,1)$
\end_inset

, we also get the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $X-(1+i)$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, this factor is repeated twice.
 The factor 
\begin_inset Formula $X-(1-i)$
\end_inset

 is also repeated twice.
 That is why the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{2}-2X+2$
\end_inset

 appears in 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{4,3}(X)$
\end_inset

 with 2 as exponent.
 This phenomenon does not occur over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{p}$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, there are examples where the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{p,k}(X)$
\end_inset

 is tight.

\begin_layout Example
Consider the sequence
